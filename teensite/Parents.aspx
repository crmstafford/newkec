            Start an EcoClub at Your Child’s School
        </strong>
        <br/><br />
        <span class="greycontent">
            Unfortunately very few schools have an environmental club or other related outlets for
            interested students. Join KidsEcoClub (KEC) to establish and support an on-campus Eco
            Club at your child’s school.  KEC’s website will host and support both after school
            environmental club websites and classroom club websites. In the near future, each will
            be able to customize their website by color, name and content. Customized content will
            include pictures, video, articles, newsletters, events, fund-raising goals/status,
            forums and blogs. The creation and support of clubs is a driving program within the KEC
            organization and a program that has the potential to reach hundreds of thousands of Kids,
            thereby resulting in a significant impact on the eco-consciousness and environmental
            education of K-12 students.          
            <br /><br />
            School EcoClubs are a fun way to bring students, parents and teachers together in a common
            mission to help the environment.  For example, EcoClubs can:
            <ul class="greycontent">
              <li>Bring naturalists, artists, scientists, engineers, business leaders and other professionals
              to your school to lead nature walks, field trips, art lessons, lecture and organize projects.</li>
              <li>Conduct school energy audits.</li>
              <li>Start campus wide recycling efforts.</li>
              <li>Increase the collective eco-consciousness of students and educators.</li>
              <li>Participate in field trips.</li>
              <li>Receive leadership training.</li>
              <li>Access innovative social media to connect clubs and classrooms across town and the country.</li>
            </ul>
        </span>
        <span class="greycontent">
            KidsEcoClub will provide support for club formation, environmental activities and projects, resource lists,
            sample agendas, sample projects and access to volunteers.
