        </span>
        <span class="greycontent">
            Telephone survey by USDA Forest Service researchers to better understand how much time children spend outdoors and the activities that they engage in while outside.
            Key findings include: 1) over the two survey periods since 2007, about 61% of children were reported to spend two or more hours outdoors on a typical weekday and
            about 77% were reported to spend two or more hours outdoors on a typical weekend day; 2) more younger children (6- to 15-years-old) were reported to spend 2 or
            more hours outdoors as compared to older children (16- to 19-years-old) and more Hispanic children were reported to spend 4 or more hours per day outdoors
            on weekends as compared to white or black children; 3) the most popular outdoor activity reported was “just playing or hanging out outdoors” at 83% followed
            by “biking, jogging, walking, skate boarding, etc.” at 79%.<br />

        <b>Wild Play — Parenting Adventures in the Great Outdoors</b><br />
        </span>
        <span class="greycontent">
            by David Sobel, Sierra Club Books, 239 pages;<br />
            Excerpts from a review:  Sobel records his experiences with his children and nature, and describes how the natural world helped to shape the adults they have become today.
            Sobel’s work is also an exploration in parenting in general, and offers advice on how to sense and guide your child’s passions, as well as how to use nature to help
            them grow.  The guiding principle in Sobel’s book is that if a child has enough euphoric experiences in his or her childhood, the fondness he or she feels for the
            natural world will become the basis for a strong environmental ethic that will stay with them throughout life.<br />
