            <b>David Sobel (2008) - The Orion Society<br /></b><br />
            &quot;After a century of educating young people to be mobile, rootless, and autistic toward their places, better ideas are gaining steam
            David Sobel’s book is about a revolution in education that is connecting students to their neighborhoods, communities, and ecologies,
            and equipping them to be homecomers, stewards, citizens and more. It is about joining heads, hands, hearts, and the places in which we
            might dwell with competent affection.&quot;<br />

            <b>Richard Louv (2006) - Algonquin Books</b><br />
            &quot;Gathering thoughts from parents, teachers, researchers, environmentalists and other concerned parties, Louv argues for a return to
            an awareness of and appreciation for the natural world. Not only can nature teach kids science and nurture their creativity, he says,
            nature needs its children: where else will its future stewards come from? Louv's book is a call to action, full of warnings—but also
            full of ideas for change.&quot;<br />

            Here is an outstanding article by Cindy Jenson-Elliott, science teacher at The Child’s Primary School, San Diego, CA.<br />
            For students, parents and teacher, Tecolote Canyon became more than a place to learn science. It became a place to directly experience earth’s amazing capacity
            for renewal — and in the process, to renew ourselves. It became a place to measure our own impact on the world, a place where many students developed
            their first relationship with a healthy plane.<br />
