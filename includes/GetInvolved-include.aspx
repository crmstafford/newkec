        <span class="greycontent">
            KidsEcoClub is in need of binoculars, telescopes and digital cameras. We welcome donations of these items in working condition.
            <br /><br />
            <b>Binoculars:</b> Small to medium sized are best as the kids will be on foot. As long as the prisms are still working, kids won’t
            mind what the outside looks like. All functioning models will be used for field trips and will directly benefit the educational experience of a child.
            <br /><br />
            <b>Cameras:</b>  Digital cameras in good working order are needed for photographic arts portion of field trips.  Graduate, and under graduate
            students along with professional photographer-volunteers, will accompany naturalists and/or lead field trips and teach children how to capture
            images of wild life, flowers, insects etc.  Some photographs will be submitted to the Noah Project to support scientific research.  Other photographs
            will be used in art programs, classroom discussions etc.  Photographs may also be selected for inclusion in KidsEcoClub website and/or newsletter.  
            <br /><br />

            <strong class="h1green">Give to KidsEcoClub on behalf of your friends and family</strong><br /><br />
            Your gift recipient will receive a card relating a story of the impact your donation has made enclosed with a packet of local plant and/or
            flower seeds. You may make a donation in any amount or choose from the below: <br /><br />
            <b>“Nurture green thumbs”- $50</b><br />
            Your symbolic gift of $50 enables students to grow a delectable edible garden in a schoolyard, learning outside the classroom about food
            systems and healthy eating habits. Or you enable community groups to provide repose in a tranquil garden. KidsEcoClubs provides expertise
            for planning and design, tools, plants, seeds and stewardship to ensure these gardens - and gardeners - flourish
            <br /><br />
            <b>“A Naturalist for Every Classroom”- $180</b><br />
            Your gift of $180 will fund a Naturalist, who will conduct a field trip for a class or KidsEcoClub group. Field trips are a popular
            experiential form of learning that excites the imagination of students and actively involves teachers.  However, as school district
            budgets continue to shrink, most schools struggle to fund these important learning tools.  Your gift of $180 will provide 25-30 students
            with a vital field trip experience that will greatly enhance their education.  
            <br /><br />
            <b>“Transporting and Transforming”- $240</b><br />
            Your gift of $240 will provide much needed bus transportation for up to three classrooms benefiting 75-90 students and their educators.  
            <br /><br />
            <b>“School Environmental Club Champion”- $500</b><br />
            Your gift of $500 will provide a start-up fund for a KidsEcoClub chapter at a school. You may designate the school you wish this fund
            to go to and/or a particular environmental project.  
<!--
            <br /><br />
            <b>“The Gift of Interactive Learning”- $3500</b><br />
            Your gift of $3500 will connect classrooms to laboratory-studio and/or fieldtrips for interactive learning experiences with live marine
            organisms, microscopy, video and other multi-media to be accessed via website in conjunction with EEI curriculum.  This content will be
            hosted and archived on our website for education use nationwide.
