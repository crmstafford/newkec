            International, LaVita and KEC.   The Team will undertake an innovative pilot program at EJS Academies Charter School starting in September of 2013
            to provide free monthly services such as: integrative medical clinics; health fairs; sustainable food and agricultural education; core STEAM content;
            and, education related to environmental sustainability. The pilot will include all 700 students and their families, reaching over 5,000 people.

            <strong>San Diego Youth Leadership & Dialog Summit Series</strong>
        </span>
        <br /><br />
        <span class="greycontent">
        Through collaboration with the University of San Diego and Public Conversations West, the San Diego Youth Leadership & Dialog Summit Series was launched in
        February 2013!  It will conclude in June of 2013. The pilot program integrates forty San Diego 8th and 9th graders from diverse cultural and socioeconomic
        backgrounds to cultivate key life skills and share in collaborative project building, dialogue, and entrepreneurial development. San Diego's children live
        in communities separated by socio-economic conditions, as well as race, ethnic background, and language. As a result, children in under-resourced communities
        have little access to leadership development experiences available in more affluent areas, and those in highly resourced communities often have no idea
        of the innovative and resilient ways complex challenges are met in under-resourced communities. Research shows that children and youth who learn to work
        collaboratively across differences, with opportunities for dialogue, peer instruction, and participation in large events are most likely to develop
        lifelong leadership skills.
        <br /><br />
        The extended program of 280 students will begin in fall 2013. The students will be divided into small groups of twenty, comprised of 75% students from
        Title I schools. Each student will attend four summits including presentations by well-known leaders and entrepreneurs.  After each lecture, students will
        break into small group workshops facilitated by PCWest-trained USD students. In these groups, students will apply what they have learned from the presentations
        to collaborate on a large-scale project of their own inspiration and design. Students will meet with the same group during each summit in order to build
        lasting relationships, deep understanding, and substantial projects. The extended program will run through the full academic year, with each group attending
        a summit every other month, for a total of eight summits.   In the in-between months, the student groups will remain connected through linked and hosted
        websites, with mentoring from USD students and KEC.
        <br /><br />
        At the close of the Program, student groups will implement their collaborative project, including presenting relevant findings and recommendations to
        community/city leaders and classrooms throughout San Diego.
        <br /><br />
        Program Objectives:
        <br />
        <ol start="1">
        <li>Prepare San Diego youth for the next level of leadership by building communication skills in speaking, listening and inquiry for information-gathering,
        relationship-building, and effective collaboration.</li>
        <li>Provide a platform for integrated, experiential and project-based learning, with opportunities for peer instruction, peer learning, and grouping diverse
        sets of students together for joint analysis of community issues, linking the local to the global.</li>
        <li>Build the capacity of students to communicate across and beyond differences and mutual stereotypes by teaching and practicing the use of dialogue.</li>

        <span class="greycontent">
        In March 2013, Green Youth Council member Evan Lewis spoke before the Solana City Beach Council against repealing the paper bag fee, which if successful,
        would undermine the single use plastic bag ban. Evan passionately spoke in support of the plastic bag ban last year, resulting in its passage in Solana Beach. 
        <br /><br />
        Evan was recently asked by the Encinitas City Council to present his views on banning single use plastic bags. Check back for the date and time. Way to go Evan!
