            <b>Kids</b><br />
            We take seriously our responsibility to our many young consumers. Our sites have been designed for our adult consumers and to enjoy,
            but they also have been designed to be accessible, safe for kids of all ages, and to adhere to all applicable laws and regulations.
            Children under the age of 13 and their parents should review the section of this policy called "A Word to Parents About Kids' Privacy"
            which discusses the special steps we take for young children who may visit our pages.
            <br /><br />
            <b>How We Collect Information</b><br />
            Below are some of the ways in which a visitor may provide information to us on-line and how we may use that information.
            <br /><br />
            <b>Domain Name Recognition</b><br />
            Our web servers automatically recognizes a visitor's domain name, however, they do not recognize a visitor's e-mail.
            <br /><br />
            <b>Use Of Cookies</b><br />
            Cookies and web beacons are small bits of information that a web site transfers to an individual's computer for record keeping purposes.
            We use cookies in a variety of ways to create a more personalized on-line experience for the user. For example, cookies may be used to
            reduce the number of repeat questions provided, to ensure that a promotion is not entered more than the permitted number of times, or
            to monitor how effective our ads on third party sites are at bringing visitors to our web pages. We use a cookie in the Chapter Club area
            when you build a custom website and in relation to volunteer and membership databases. This cookie is stored within your browser. The purpose
            for this cookie is to allow the system to recognize you as a return visitor. A cookie is used for user profile verification as well.
            Personally identifiable information which may be obtained through cookies or web beacons is not sold, rented or provided to third parties
            and is not used internally by for any purpose other than to enhance your experience on our web site and to provide services and/or offers
            to you related to KidsEcoClub.
            <br /><br />
            <b>Information Actively Provided by Our Visitors</b><br />
            We do not require visitors to register or provide any information before entering our web sites. However, there are several places where
            visitors may choose to provide personally identifiable information about themselves or other people. Unless we tell you otherwise, KidsEcoClub
            will use the information for the purpose the information was provided.
            <br /><br />
            For example:
            <ul class="greycontent">
            <li>Questions: On some pages our visitors can submit comments or ask questions. The only personally identifiable information that we collect
            is the sender's e-mail address. We save e-mail addresses associated with questions in order to respond to those questions and provide information
            about KidsEcoClub.</li>
            <li>Promotions/Contests: We frequently offer promotions and contests on our pages. In order to enter a promotion and/or contest or to access
            certain web site content, we might require you to register online. All visitors under the age of 13 must gain permission from a parent or guardian
            prior to completing their online registration. During the registration process, we collect information necessary for prize fulfillment and/or
            participation and will not share this information with any third party companies unless it is for prize fulfillment purposes. If you win a prize
            or contest, additional information may be collected offline for tax and prize fulfillment purposes. Your online registration may be used across
            our web sites to enter multiple promotions and/or sweepstakes or to access certain content. The first initial, last name, hometown and state of
            all winners will be included on a Winners List. The Winners List will be provided upon request and as required by law. Information required for
            tax purposes, the Winner's List or other information required by law is kept as required by law. We also may use the email address that you
            provide to send you promotional offers if you opt in.</li>
            <li>E-mail Newsletters: If you are over the age of 13, some of our pages permit you to register to receive e-mail newsletters or updates in the
            future by providing your e-mail address. Any e-mail you receive from KidsEcoClub will allow you to change your preference or "unsubscribe" from
            this informational service at any time. At the bottom of each promotional email, there is a link stating "Click here to change or remove your
            subscription". Clicking that link will lead to a page where you can immediately remove your subscription.</li>
            <li>Auctions: Visitors to some of our web sites can participate in on-line auctions. We only collect information which is required for
            participation in the auction and delivery of merchandise to auction winners. All personally identifiable information submitted is used for
            the purpose of the auction. The same information may also be used to facilitate that same visitor's entry into a sweepstakes or contest so
            that the consumer does not have to repeatedly enter the same information.</li>
            <li>Other Features: There may be other features available on our web sites which may require some personally identifiable information to use
            the feature. We only use the personally identifiable information to provide the feature.</li>
            <li>Chapter Clubs:  All visitors under the age of 13 must gain permission from a parent or guardian prior to completing their online
            registration for a KidsEcoClub Chapter website. During the registration process, we collect information necessary for participation and will
            not share this information with any third party companies unless it is for prize fulfillment purposes. If you win a prize or contest, additional
            information may be collected offline for tax and prize fulfillment purposes. Your online registration may be used across our web sites to enter
            multiple promotions and/or contests or to access certain content. The first initial, last name, hometown and state of all winners will be
            included on a Winners List. The Winners List will be provided upon request and as required by law. Information required for tax purposes,
            the Winner's List or other information required by law is kept as required by law. We also may use the email address that you provide to send

            </ul>
        </span>
        <span class="greycontent">
            <b>Business Partners and/or Affiliates and/or Schools</b><br />
            We have some business partners with whom we may operate some of our pages and share information. For example, on occasion we may offer a contest
            or sweepstakes jointly with another company. In such instances, information may be shared with the co-sponsor so that the contest or sweepstakes
            may be conducted.  We do share information regarding naturalist guides, STEM professionals, parent volunteers, undergraduate, graduate students,
            professors, educators, park rangers, docents and volunteers with school districts, allied organizations and educators for purposes of conducting
            field trips, security screening and collaboration. 
            <b>Aggregate Information</b><br />
            Aggregate information about which pages visitors access or visit (for example, to enter a visitor in a contest or to send the visitor information)
            is used for internal review as we continue to improve our web site. This information may be transferred to Ning and Neon and/or other third party
            vendors, which are used to support newsletters, blogs, forums, websites, twitter, face book, and other media related to the KidsEcoClub website
            and services. Non-personally identifiable aggregate information is shared with third parties. If you prefer not to allow us to collect this
            information, you can do so by turning off the cookies in your browser, although some areas of our websites may not function properly if you do.
            We do not rent or sell  e-mail addresses with any other company or organization.
            <br /><br />
            Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us on-line in ways unrelated to the ones described above without
            also providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses.
            <b>Our Commitment To Data Security</b><br />
            To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical,
            electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect on-line.
            <br /><br />
            <b>A Word To Parents About Kids' Privacy</b><br />
            Our sites have been designed primarily for adult consumers to enjoy, but they also have been designed to be accessible, safe for kids of all ages,
            and to adhere to all applicable laws and regulations. There are some extra precautions that we take, however, with respect to collecting information
            from children under 13.
            <ul class="greycontent">
            <li>All website registrants or members will be requested to provide their age. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from
            children under 13 on-line without first obtaining permission from the child's parent or guardian. When a child under 13 years old attempts to register
            for a promotion or contest, start a KidsEcoClub Chapter, submit articles, photographs, or video, we send their parent or guardian an e-mail to get
            their permission to collect the child's personally identifiable information as part of their registration. If we do not receive permission within
            14 days, we will delete the child's request and they will not be able to complete their registration online. Once a parent or guardian gives their
            permission for their child to register, the parent will be asked to complete the child's mailing information on behalf of the child.  When complete,
            the child will be able to enter future registration-based contests and/or participations without any further requests of consent to the parent.
            Should the child's personally identifiable information require updating, the parent will be required to make any and all updates to their child's
            online registration information on behalf of the child. If a child under 13 is a winner, we will contact you and/or your child by e-mail for prize
            fulfillment purposes.</li>
            <li>We do not require a child to provide more personally identifiable information than is reasonably necessary to participate in an activity.
            (You may wish to be aware that, according to the FTC, web site operators are not permitted to collect more information than is needed for a child
            to participate in an on-line activity.)</li>
            <li>Our web sites do offer activities that allow your child to disclose your child's personal information publicly (for example through chat rooms,
            forum groups, Twitter, Facebook and or message boards).  Please instruct your child to NEVER arrange a face-to-face meeting with someone they met
            on-line; NEVER give out personal identifying information such as their name, home address, school name, address, team name; NEVER respond to messages
            or bulletin board postings that are suggestive, obscene, belligerent or harassing.  Visit www.NetSmartz.org or www.cybertipline.com.  And for

            <li>We do not share your child's personally identifiable information with third parties.</li>
            <li>If you would like to review personally identifiable information about your child that we have on file, or request that certain information be
            changed or deleted, please contact:<br />

            <b>How You Can Access Or Correct Your Information</b><br />
