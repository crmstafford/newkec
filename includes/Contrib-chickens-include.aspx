        Keeping chickens is a great way to make eggs and profit from their fertilizer. Chickens are known for their multiple uses, the most popular being eggs. They are charming and
        amusing pets, make great lawn ornaments (ha!), and are easy to care for.
        <br /><br />
        Life with chickens is very enjoyable and fun, but you might want to consider some things before making the decision to have a chicken. <i>Where are you going to buy your chickens?
        Does your schedule permit caring for your chickens? Do you have enough space for your chickens, and does the law allow for the keeping of your chickens? Do you want your
        chickens to be tamed easily? What happens when you go on a vacation?</i> If you thought about these, then you are set to pick your chickens!
        <br /><br />
        There are many breeds to choose from, and they come in a significant range of size, plumage, colors, and personality. Having a variety of chickens in your flock will create an
        interesting diversity of pets, which will result in a wide array of egg shapes, colors, and sizes. If you visit www.mypetchicken.com you will easily find information on
        chickens including breeds, colors, histories, how much food and water they need, and much more. 
        <br /><br />
        Housing and shelter for the chickens is simple, whether you have a small flock in a chicken igloo or a very large flock in a henhouse. A chicken igloo (much like a dogloo) is
        a plastic dome ideal for housing 1 to 3 chickens. It is designed to be easily cleaned and compact, and is perfect for first time owners. It consists of a perch for sleeping,
        and one egg-laying box. Typically straw will be used on the "floor" of the chicken shelter; this is to prevent unsanitary conditions. Any chicken housing has to be cleaned
        thoroughly every once in a while to maintain sanitary conditions. After you have provided suitable shelter and housing, chickens already do a very good job keeping themselves
        clean and stopping parasites from settling into their coat of feathers. A couple times a day, chickens will find a dusty and dirty spot to sit and then throw dirt on themselves
        and shaking it off to try to force the mites out. This is called a "dirt bath" and you will notice that the chickens appear to enjoy it.
        <br /><br />
        Mature chickens will not only eat chicken feed but also kitchen scraps. If you want to herd your chickens, a good tip is to use "scratch feed", which is dessert to chickens.
        Baby chickens will eat chicken feed as well as a chick starter, which is a mix of enzymes, protein, and many more vital nutrients. All chickens need water but baby chickens
        need a number of additional needs that mature chickens need. Baby chickens need a heat lamp because their coat of feathers is not completely developed. They also need the
        enzyme and protein mix because the digestive system is not powerful enough for normal food yet.  When hens mature, they will lay eggs mostly during the summer without the
        need of a rooster. If you plan to have your eggs fertilized, you will need a rooster. Keep in mind that most cities and communities will not allow rooster because they wake
        up at 4:30 in the morning and let everyone know that it is time to get up (this is not a myth, they will wake you and your neighbors up). Note that different breeds produce
        different eggs. Eggs contain about 70 percent water and 30 percent protein, fat, minerals and vitamins. Home grown organic free range eggs are the best eggs because they
        are free, taste better, and are healthier for you. 
        <br /><br />
        Raising chickens is a great way to have interesting and unusual pets while having a virtually endless supply of delicious eggs. As with all pets, raising the babies can
        take a little extra care but the full-grown chickens essentially take care of themselves, and are amusing characters that seem to take pride in being the family pet.
