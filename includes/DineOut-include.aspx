        Dine Out for the Earth! is an event to promote local, sustainable and organic foods. Restaurants participating in this event donate a portion of the
        proceeds to help support local K-12 school environmental clubs, and the Healthy People, Healthy Community, Healthy Planet Collaborative, which provides free
        health services and clinics to schools as well as supports local farm to school programs.  That means that if you dine out at one of the participating restaurants
        listed below on the dates indicated, you can enjoy a good meal with friends and family and benefit the environment at the same time, without spending an extra dime!
        <br /><br />
        Please be sure to tell your server that you are celebrating Dine Out for the Earth to ensure that KEC receives the donation.
