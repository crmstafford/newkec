                            <b>Dr. Amy Parish - Secretary</b><br />
                            Dr. Amy Parish is a Biological Anthropologist, Primatologist, and Darwinian Feminist who has taught at University of Southern California in the Gender Studies,
                            Arts and Letters, and Anthropology programs and departments since 1999. She received her undergraduate training at University of Michigan and her graduate school

                            Germany on the topic of reciprocity. <br /><br />
                            Dr. Parish has been studying the world’s captive population of bonobos for the last twenty years. The bonobo, whose name derives from the ancient Batu word
                            for ancestor, is one of the two species comprising the chimpanzee genus. Bonobos and chimpanzees are the two closest living relatives of humans living today.

                            In 2008, she received a Mellon Award for excellence in faculty mentoring of undergraduate students. Dr. Parish teaches with the goal of helping students to
                            internalize learning enough to pursue it in the future in their own ways. She wants active learners to emerge—students who make sense of the world through
                            their own eyes, experiences, and values, so that they might be significantly enriched by their educational experiences. She also hopes to engage the students
                            in activist pursuits that might lead to more community involvement in their post-campus lives. Dr. Parish is Co-Founder of WorldWideVisionaries.org, an online
                            forum for young people to develop and exchange ideas about working on social justice and environmental causes.
