                        Jared and Alex blog about Genetically Modified Organisms - GMOs, plants or animals created through the gene splicing techniques of biotechnology
                        (also called genetic engineering, or GE). This experimental technology merges DNA from different species, creating combinations of plant, animal,
                        bacterial and viral genes that are unlikely to occur in nature or in traditional crossbreeding.

                        The safety of GMOs is a topic that generates a lot of heated debate on both sides. In nearly 50 countries around the world, including Australia, Japan, and all of the countries in
                        the European Union, there are significant restrictions or outright bans on the production and sale of GMOs. In the U.S., the government has approved GMOs
                        based on studies conducted by the corporations that created and sell them.   Follow our blog as we learn more about GMOs.
