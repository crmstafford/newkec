                            coast, Seagulls were a constant problem on campus due to the amount of trash left by students following
                            meal and snack breaks.  Amber also loves gardening and started a garden at her apartment complex with her
                            younger brothers. She volunteers frequently and is a member of the Price Charities Cardinal Interact
                            program, which works to improve her community.  Amber is working to expand the school clean-up, recycling

                            <b>Evan L.</b><br />
                            Evan is a 6th grade Seminar student in Southern California. He is passionate about eliminating single use plastic bags due to
                            his concern about marine animals and the growing Pacific Garbage Patch. His article “The Problem With Plastic Bags” was
                            featured in the April 2012 edition of Earth Times.  Evan publically spoke  before the Solana Beach City Council members and
                            encouraged them to vote yes and reduce single use plastic bags in their community. Moments after this the council voted
                            unanimously in favor making Solana Beach the first community in San Diego County to pass such legislation. He started a
                            petition to ban the sale and distribution of single use plastic bags within the City Of San Diego as well. 
                            Evan is a member of the Solana Beach Clean and Green Committee, which is instrumental in performing energy
                            audits, outreach, sustainability evaluations and recycling for the community.  In addition, Evan has
                            spoken out on the need to save the honey bees as well as written an informative article on bees. Evan has
                            been recognized as an “Outstanding Ambassador for Civic Youth Engagement” by the San Diego Foundation.
                            His favorite subjects in school are math and science. He loves sports and his favorites are soccer, tennis,
                            basketball, skiing and surfing. He thinks the environment is very important
                            because without nature we cannot survive. He believes we all need to work together to protect nature and
                            all the animals in it because they all contribute their part to the ecosystem.

                            <b>Max G.</b><br />
                            Max started KidsEcoClub at the age of ten. He is now thirteen. Max received an award from the State of California, Board of Equalization, for Youth Civic
            Engagement on February 1, 2014. He is the recipient of the 2013 Youth Change-Maker award from the San Diego Unified School District Board of Education and
            a 2012 Earth Award from Earth Works for his work to support healthy students, healthy communities and a healthy planet. Max is also an Ambassador to the
            San Diego Foundation’s 50-year strategic plan for the region and was recognized as an “Outstanding Ambassador for Civic Youth Engagement." He is an
            activist, starting a Change.org petition to President Obama to ban the sale and distribution of shark fin products in the United States. The petition
            garnered support from the Birch Aquarium, Wild Aid, Deep Sea News and the Center for Marine Biodiversity and Conservation at the Scripps Institution
            of Oceanography. He posted an official comment opposing the Georgia Aquarium's request to bring 18 wild caught beluga whales to the United States for
            display  and distribution. His vision of a sustainable world is one in which our planet is clean and safe, with enough food, water and space for everyone,
            including animals and fish. His hobbies include collecting animal skulls from his many hikes in the Rocky Mountains. This interest was sparked by the
            discovery of a beaver skull on the roof of his home in Colorado. The beaver was carried there and eaten by a Great Horned Owl. Max especially loves owls
            and started a successful collaboration with the wood shop at Clairemont High in San Diego to build barn owl nesting boxes, which are given to public
            schools to raise awareness about owls. Max frequently speaks to students about the dangers of using poisons to control the rodent population due to
            the secondary kill rates among owls, hawks, foxes, coyotes and other animals. He wants you to know that a pair of nesting owls kills 2,000 rodents per
            year! In addition, Max is a club basketball player, fair golfer, snowboarder, surfer, birder and avid fisherman. He enjoys all things outdoors.

                            Milena is a high schooler in Southern California.  Her vision of a sustainable earth is one in which there is public transportation
                            available to people all over the world, and where students have access to the knowledge and learning necessary to ponder and solve
                            the environmental problems of the world.  She enjoys walking around her community and hanging out with friends, rollerblading, training
                            for track and field, and relaxing.  Milena joined KEC because she has a passion for science and would like to use that passion to
                            support the student environmental movement and help create a world that educates people so that they can make the best decision.
                            Milena was recognized as an "Outstanding Ambassador for Civic Youth Engagement" by the San Diego Foundation and has participated
                            in the San Diego Youth Leadership Summits convened by Kids Eco Club, University of San Diego, Public Conversations West, and
                            Intellectual Capital, Inc.  During the summit her group helped organize a community clean up in Terra Alta and City Heights.  This was
                            organized in collaboration with Dad's club, Wilson Middle School, Central Elementary School, Global Institute for Public Strategies,
                            and City Heights Community Environment Corporation and contribute to their much larger clean-up event.  We organized this in order to
                            educate people in the community about what is and isn't recyclable, and help them sort through what was being picked up in the park.
                            She also enjoys programming and constructing robots with the FIRST Robotics Competition team at her school.
