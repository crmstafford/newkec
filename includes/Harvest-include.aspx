            NEED FOR PROGRAM
        </strong>
        <br/><br />
        <span class="greycontent">
            Millions of pounds of fresh, consumable produce are being thrown out or left to waste while people go hungry every day.
            Unfortunately the systems in place to recover and distribute food, including many food banks, are largely devoid of fresh produce and vegetables.
            However, fresh produce is essential to a healthy diet and should be provided whenever possible to those who cannot afford it.
            Young children are especially at risk for malnourishment and the most in need of proper nutrition due to the demands of their growth and development.

        <b><i>When Despair for the world grows in me and I wake in the night at the least sound in fear of what my life and my children’s lives may be,
        I go and lie down where the wood drake rests in his beauty on the water, and the great heron feeds.  I come into the peace of wild things…
        I rest in the grace of the world, and I am free.</i></b><br />
