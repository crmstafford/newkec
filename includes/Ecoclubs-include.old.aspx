            How to Start an On Campus School EcoClub <br />in a few easy steps<br /> 
        </strong>
        <ul class="greycontent">
        <li><b>Step 1: Review KidsEcoClub’s  Mission and Vision Statements</b><br />
        Please review KidsEcoClubs’s Mission and Vision and confirm that you will support and uphold them as you run an EcoClub. If so, then proceed to Step 2<br />&nbsp;<br /></li>    
        <li><b>Step 2: Contact KidsEcoClub.</b><br />
        Send an email to <a href="mailto:clubs@kidsecoclub.org">clubs@kidsecoclub.org</a> to express your interest in starting an EcoClub and to ask any questions you might have about KEC.<br />&nbsp;<br /></li>
        <li><b>Step 3: Talk to Your School about Starting an EcoClub on Your Campus.</b><br />
        Ask your school about how to start a student organization. Typically, schools require student organizations to adopt a set of by-laws or rules, have a core-group of officers,
        a faculty advisor and agree to abide by school rules. You can give them a copy of <a href="../Documents/kec-overview.pdf" target="_blank">KEC’s Overview</a> to give them a better sense of the organization. <br />&nbsp;<br /></li>
        <li><b>Step 4: Review Club Manual</b><br />
        The <a href="../Documents/kec-manual-color.pdf" target="_blank">KEC Club Manual</a> contains procedures; information on how to start a school based EcoClub;  sample bylaws; meeting agendas;  club officers duties;  project ideas; resources;  potential meeting topics; and forms.<br />&nbsp;<br /></li>
        <li><b>Step 5: Start Your Own Customized EcoClub Website through KEC</b><br />
        (Coming soon)<br />
        Select a Webmaster within your club and use KEC’s EcoClub template to start your website.  Contact us for details.

        <ul>
            <li><b>Recruit 4-6 core people to help you.</b><br />
            Find a few friends and a 'Nature Champion' at your school (typically a teacher or parent) to help you with the club. This core group can form your leadership team.</li>

            <li><b>Appointment of a temporary chairman or president.</b><br />
            At first you will need to assign a temporary leader to preside over the drive to form the club. This may or may not be the person who serves as permanent chairman or president.</li>

            <li><b>Election of temporary officers.</b><br />
            The members should discuss which officer appointments are necessary for your club. Decide whether you want a president or chairman; whether you want a vice president; whether you need a treasurer;
            and whether you need someone to keep the minutes of each meeting.</li>

            <li><b>Preparation of by-laws or rules.</b><br />
            Decide upon a committee to write the by-laws or rule booklet. See these sample by-laws.</li>

            <li><b>Adoption of by-laws or rules.  See sample by-laws.</b><br />
            Once the by-laws or rules are written to everyone's satisfaction, you will vote to adopt them.</li>

            <li><b>Election of permanent officers.</b><br />
            At this time you can decide if your club has enough officer positions or if you need to add some positions. Some of the positions you should consider are listed below.
            <br /><b>Club Positions:</b>
            <ul>
                <li>President: Leads meetings</li>
                <li>Vice president: Supports the president and helps plan events</li>
                <li>Secretary: Records and reads minutes</li>
                <li>Treasurer: Handles funds</li>
                <li>Historian: Keeps a picture book and notes</li>
                <li>Publicity Officer: Makes and distributes flyers, posters</li>
                <li>Webmaster: Maintains web site </li>
            </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        -->
        <br /></li>
<!--
        <li><b>Step 6: Review and Sign the EcoClub Charter.</b><br />
        Download the EcoClub Charter. Once you sign the Charter your club will be an official EcoClub.
        <br />&nbsp;<br /></li>

        <li><b>Step 7: Prepare for First Meeting and Publicize.</b><br />
        Spread the word and call for your first meeting! It is helpful to have a game plan-- a calendar of events or topics for discussion. While all the planning doesn't
        have to be done before the club first forms, it helps to have at least a basic idea of what sorts of topics you will cover, activities you will do, and speakers you
        will host before you get started. We have access to a number of speakers and individuals willing to help. Just let us know what you need.
        <br /><br />
        To have meetings you will need to reserve a meeting room. Most schools allow student groups to use classrooms or meeting rooms for their gatherings. A meeting room
        or classroom which holds 20 to 40 people is ideal for an EcoClub meeting.
        <br /><br />
        <b>General Order of a Meeting</b><br />
        You can use these steps as a guideline for your meetings. Your specific style can be less formal, or even more formal, according to your goals and tastes.
        <ul>
            <li>Call to order by the president or chairman</li>
            <li>Reading and approval of the minutes from the previous meeting</li>
            <li>Discussion of old business</li>
            <li>Discussion of new business</li>
            <li>Program</li>
            <li>Adjournment</li>
        </ul>
        <br /></li>
